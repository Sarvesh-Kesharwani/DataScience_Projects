It shouldn't be used for training the machine learning model, but can be useful for filtering rows.\n","4. The age can be found by usng the record date and the birth date. So one set may be dropped.\n","5. The length of service can be found using the record date and the original hire date. So one set may be dropped.\n","6. The termination date uses 1/1/1900 if the employee is still active. \n","7. The store_name is given as a number, even though it is a nominal categorical feature. The store name itself is unlikely to be cause of employment termination, but particular feature values may be associated with particular stores.

An employee whose employment is terminated has valid entries for termination date, termination reason and termination type.
